This folder contains:
- nn_uniciclo_simple.py = code to train a simple 1-hidden layer neural network
- unicycle_model_state_simple.pth = file that contains the trained neural network. Needed to load the add the trained network to the neural MPC code
- unicycle_neuralmpc_simple.py = code to run a neural MPC using the trained network to model the differential equation of the unicycle in the solver
